We are making a REST API - JSON



A hybrid server can serve both web browsers and mobile apps using the same API.
/api/ helps separate API routes from regular web pages.

Example:

https://example.com/home → Loads a web page (HTML, CSS, JS).
https://example.com/api/users → Loads JSON data for web/mobile apps.



GET /api/users - list of users

GET /api/users/1 - Get the user with ID 1
GET /api/users/2 - Get the user with ID 2

POST /api/users - Create new userr

PATCH /api/user/id - Edit the user with id(any)
GET /api/users:id
Dynamic Path Parameters 
:id -> dynamic variable 


DELETE /api/user/id - Delete the user with id(any)


// We need user data to use it in our REST API.
// So using -> mockaroo.com

Mockaroo is a tool for generating fake data for testing and development purposes. 
It allows users to create realistic datasets in various formats, such as CSV, JSON, 
SQL, and Excel, which can be used for database seeding, testing APIs, or machine learning training.
